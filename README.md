## About me
I am a positive, hardworking, dynamic and dedicated
person with an excellent sense of organization. I see
myself as a very hard-working and responsible student,
with a remarkable theoretical background and significant
advanced potential. In addition to my involvement in the
field of computer engineering, I have been involved in
various extracurricular activities and projects.
Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.
I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience.
